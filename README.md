`term-transcript` is a Rust library and a CLI app that allow to:

- Create transcripts of interacting with a terminal, capturing both the output text
  and [ANSI-compatible color info][SGR].
- Save these transcripts in the [SVG] format, so that they can be easily embedded as images
  into HTML / Markdown documents. Rendering logic can be customized via [Handlebars] template engine;
  thus, other output formats besides SVG (e.g., HTML) are possible.
- Parse transcripts from SVG.
- Test that a parsed transcript actually corresponds to the terminal output (either as text
  or text + colors).

The primary use case is easy to create and maintain end-to-end tests for CLI / REPL apps.
Such tests can be embedded into a readme file.

## Usage

`term-transcript` comes in two flavors: a [Rust library](lib), and a [CLI app](cli).
The CLI app has slightly less functionality, but does not require Rust knowledge.
See their docs and the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for usage guidelines and troubleshooting advice.

### Examples

An SVG snapshot of [the `rainbow` example](e2e-tests/rainbow)
produced by this crate:

![Snapshot of rainbow example](examples/rainbow.svg)

A snapshot of the same example with the scrolling animation and window frame:

![Animated snapshot of rainbow example](examples/animated.svg)

A snapshot of a similar example rendered to HTML using [a custom template](examples/custom.html.handlebars)
is available [as a source file](examples/rainbow.html) and [in the rendered form][html-example].

See the [`examples` directory](examples) for more snapshot examples.
